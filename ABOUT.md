What I wanted to accomplish : 
1)To preview hotels in cards.
2)Work more on validations and data types of the filters.
3)General improvements on the UI.
Though Process:
As soon as I started working on the task, I wanted to make sure I knew how to deploy the application on heroku since I've never used it before
and that made me even more confused since I had many langaues and platfroms to choose from.
Eventually, I picked Java since I am familiar with it and since it's deployable on heroku. 
Besides, I have NetBeans installed on my computer.
What I learned in the process:
1) Dealing with heroku which includes pushing, pulling, scaling and preparing the pom and procfile.
2) More practise on command line commands and git even more.
3) I am familiar with Java but I've never worked with in on NetBeans so it was also a new experience for me.
4) In general, this task helped me in improving my problem solving skills and search for a solution skill.
